Loops! 
Loops are very useful, you are able to execute
commands any amount of times.

There are 3 types of loops: Do While, Do Until, and For Loop

Do Until will always execute, then will always execute until false
Do While will only execute when its true, then will always execute until False
For Loop will always execute until its sequence is over,

In While Loops, and Until Loops you can make them Infinite loops
For Loops Can't be infinite and will automatically increment after executing until its done

For Examples:
	
	for i in $( ls )
	do
		echo $i
	done
	
	OUTPUT:
	(There are 4 files, FILE1 FILE2 FILE3 FILE4)
	FILE1
	FILE2
	FILE3
	FILE4

	for i in `seq 1 4`
	do
		echo $i
	done
	
	OUTPUT:
	1
	2
	3
	4

Do While Examples

	while [ true ]
	do
		echo Hi
	done
	
	^^^^ That is an infinite Loop ^^^^

	COUNTER=0
	while [ $COUNTER -lt 5 ]
	do
		echo $COUNTER
		COUNTER=$(( COUNTER+1 )) 
	done

	OUTPUT:
	0
	1
	2
	3
	4
	
Until Example:
	COUNTER=1
	until [ $COUNTER -gt 5 ]
	do
		echo $COUNTER
		COUNTER=$(( COUNTER+1 ))
	done

	OUTPUT:
	1
	2
	3
	4
	5
