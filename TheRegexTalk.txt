So Regex, probably the most ugliest thing to look at but really important
Eventually we get to the point where we cant 100% know what to expect
but we already have an idea, for example you want to validate a legit 
credit card number, and you are presented with a range of numbers, you
know a credit card number cant start off with 1 and it needs to have 16 digits
so in these circumstances we use regex.

Regex is quite powerful

But lets discuss the two anchors ^ and $:
	^ will match the beginning of the line
	$ will match the end of the line
Example:
	'^This' will match "This cat has a tail"
	`tail$` will match "This cat has a tail"

Brackets [ ]
	Using the Brackets allows you to match any one character in them/ or not any one character
Example:
	[abv] - matches anything with the characters inside the brackets
	[^abv] - will match everything else besides the characters inside the brackets
		With this one it can be tricky since if you have a string that contains
		other characters besides ab and v, it will match them so you will still match
		the lines
	[0-9] - Numeric Range -- Will match any number
	[a-z] - LowerCase Range -- will match any lowercase alpha character
	[A-Z] - UpperCase Range -- will match any uppercase alpha character
	[:aplha:] - Alpha Range -- will match any alpha character being [a-z] and [A-Z]
	[:blank:] -- Will match space or tab
	[:digit:] - Numberic Range -- will match any number
	[:alnum:] -- a-z A-Z 0-9
	[:upper:] -- A-Z range
	[:lower:] -- a-z Range 
There is more but this is good enough.
So some examples
	File "FILE" Contains Lines:
		This Should Be Enough
		01531
		0EF4A1
		ld52
	
	grep -E ^This FILE
	OUTPUT: This Should Be Enough
	grep -E Enough$ FILE
	OUTPUT: This Should Be Enough
	grep -E ^Should FILE
	OUTPUT: <EMPTY>
	grep -E [0-9] FILE
	OUTPUT: 01531
		OEF4A1
		ld52
	grep -E [0-9][A-Z] FILE
	OUTPUT: 0EF4A1
	grep -E [0-9][a-z] FILE
	OUTPUT: <EMPTY>
	grep -E [a-z][0-9] FILE
	OUTPUT: ld52

There is a lot more to learn about regex, like Extended Regex, but I am not very
familar with Regex as it is so im just going over the extent im comfortable with.

NOTE: There will not be a .sh of this example because I dont want people to run a 
	script that adds files and removes files to anyone's filesystem of my own making.
