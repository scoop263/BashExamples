If Statements - What are they?
To boil it down If Statements are basically
selective conditions, when a condition is True
then that piece will only execute.
If Conditions start with an if and it closes with fi, if backwards.
Lets say:
	Variable A is 50
	Variable B is 25

Example1:
	If A is greater than 49, then
	say "A is greater than 49"
	Syntax:
		if [[ $A -gt 49 ]]
		then
			echo "A is greater than 49"
		fi

If Else Statement, we go more indepth of If statements,
introducing Else, Else allows us to execute a condtion when
the above conditions evaluated False.

Example2:
	Using A and B from the above example
	If B is greater than 49, then say 
	"B is greater than 49", if not
	say "B is less than 49"
	Syntax:
		if [[ $B -gt 49 ]]
		then
			echo "B is greater than 49"
		else
			echo "B is less than 49"
		fi
		
	Variable B is less than 49 so it is evaluated false

Now going further in If Statements, lets introduce:
If ElseIf Statement
With this you are giving it more opportunity to evaluate True.

Example3:
	Using A and B from the above example
	If A is less than 49, then say "A is less than 49"
	If B is less than 26, then say "B is less than 26"
	If not, say "A is greater than 50 and B is greater than 26"
	Syntax:
		if [[ $A -lt 49 ]]
		then
			echo "A is less than 49"
		elif [[ $B -lt 26 ]]
		then
			echo "B is less than 26"
		else
			echo "A is greater than 50 and B is greater than 26"
		fi

	First Condition is evaluated False, Second Condition is evaluated True
